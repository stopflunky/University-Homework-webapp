# University-Homework-webapp

I just built this webapp for an University project without any framework


Front-end part: html, css javascirpt
Back-end part: php

I was basically inspired by Medium
You can browse the first 10 articles in the site and if you want to read more you log in.
After loggin-in you can read all the articles written and write article too.
